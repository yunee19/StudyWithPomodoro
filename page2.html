        <div class="description">
            <p> The Pomodoro Technique is created by Francesco Cirillo for a more productive way to work and study. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Wikipedia</a></p>

        <p> The <strong>attention span</strong>ðŸ‘€ is the ability to concentrate on a single task, the greater our concentration, the easier it will be for us to do it.<br>
        Studies have estimated that this interval lasts approximately 20 minutes.<br><br>
